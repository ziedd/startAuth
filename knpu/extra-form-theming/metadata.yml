title: Getting Crazy with Form Themes

summary: |
    We already learned *all* the [form basics](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/symfony-forms).
    But, controlling how you *render* your forms? That's a *huge* and
    super-fun topic all on its own. So let's go!
    
    * Creating your own form theme
    * Controller form variables
    * Using form variables in your theme
    * Rendering a field 100% by hand
    * Controller variables in your form type
    * Adding a "help" text system that renders for all fields
    * Leveraging a FormTypeExtension to tweak *any* field in your system
    * Customizing how a *single* field renders

    This stuff is black magic: learn these fundamentals, and you'll
    be unstoppable!
