title: Symfony: Level up with Services and the Container

summary: |
    Our app is coming to life! Thanks to the [Doctrine Course](https://knpuniversity.com/screencast/symfony-doctrine)
    we have a rich data model. And after the course on [Configuration](https://knpuniversity.com/screencast/symfony-fundamentals),
    well, using and configuring services is simple.

    Now it's time to level-up with those *services*. These
    puppies are the backbone of what makes Symfony special & fast.
    It's also the reason that organizing your code into reusable
    chunks is so easy. But beyond that, once you understand how
    services and the service container work, you'll be absolutely
    unstoppable inside of Symfony. Yep, let's do that:

    * Understanding what a service is
    * Listing, fetching and using existing services
    * Creating your own custom services
    * Registering your service
    * Checking out the (mystical) dumped container
    * Configuration Parameters
    * Dependency Injection Tags

    This is the episode where it all starts coming together. Let's go!
