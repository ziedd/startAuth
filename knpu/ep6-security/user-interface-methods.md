# The UserInterface Methods (Keep some Blank!)

Our job: fill in the *5* methods from `UserInterface`. But check this out - I'm
going rogue - I'm only going to implement *2* of them: `getUsername()` and `getRoles()`.

## getUsername()

First `getUsername()`... is super-unimportant. Just return *any* unique user string
you want - a username, an email, a uuid, a funny, but unique joke - whatever. This
is only used to show you *who* is logged in when you're debugging.

In our app, our users won't have a username - but they *will* have an email. Add a
`private $email` property then just use that in `getUsername()`: `return $this->email`:

[[[ code('6e32695c22') ]]]

And add a setter for that method:

[[[ code('c8c0b7368d') ]]]

We'll eventually need that to create users.

## getRoles()

Cool: half-way done! Now: `getRoles()`. We'll talk roles later with authorization,
but these are basically permissions we want to give the user. For now, give every
user the same, one role: `ROLE_USER`:

[[[ code('d1a940cb2b') ]]]

### What about getPassword(), getSalt() and eraseCredentials()?

So what about `getPassword()`, `getSalt()` and `eraseCredentials()`? Keep them blank:

[[[ code('0b7348fc04') ]]]

Whaat? It turns out, you *only* need these if your app is personally responsible
for storing and checking user passwords. In our app - to start - we're *not* going
to have passwords: we're just going to let anyone login with a single, central, hardcoded
password. But there are also real-world situations where your app isn't responsible
for managing and checking passwords.

If you have one of these, feel ok leaving these blank.

## Setting up the User Entity

So in our application, we want to store users in the database. So let's set this
class up with Doctrine. Copy the `use` statement from `SubFamily` and paste it here:

[[[ code('588606deb8') ]]]

Next, I'll put my cursor inside the class, press `Command`+`N` - or use the
"Code"->"Generate" menu - and select "ORM class":

[[[ code('9115aaa7d2') ]]]

Next, add a `private $id` property and press `Command`+`N` one more time. This time,
choose "ORM annotation" and highlight both fields:

[[[ code('e7fd832f18') ]]]

Oh, and while we're here, let's add `unique=true` for the email field:

[[[ code('1281ea6267') ]]]

Perfect: we have a fully functional `User` class. Sure, it only has an `id` and
`email`, but that's enough!

Since we just added a new entity, let's generate a migration:

```bash
./bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff
```

I'll copy the class and open it up quickly, just to make sure it looks right:

[[[ code('95a97d3e03') ]]]

Looks great!

## Adding User Fixtures

Finally, let's add some users to the database. Open our trusty `fixtures.yml`.
I'll copy the `SubFamily` section, change the class to `User` and give these keys
`user_1..10`:

[[[ code('a49bedd518') ]]]

Then, the only field is email. Set it to `weaverryan+<current()>@gmail.com`:

[[[ code('b15b8f1f4c') ]]]

The `current()` function will return 1 through 10 as Alice loops through our set.
That'll give us `weaverryan+1@gmail.com` up to `weaverryan+10@gmail.com`. And if you
didn't know, Gmail ignores everything after a `+` sign, so these will all be delivered
to `weaverryan@gmail.com`. There's your Internet hack for the day.

Ok, let's roll! Don't forget to run the migration first:

```bash
./bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

And then load the fixtures:

```bash
./bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

Hey hey: you've got users in the database. Let's let 'em login.
