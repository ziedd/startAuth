title: Symfony: Doctrine & the Database

summary: |
    With already *two* courses checked off, you are *primed* and ready to put
    Symfony to work! And that's what this course is all about: making things more
    interesting by talking to the database with Doctrine.

    Doctrine has a reputation for being tough to learn, and that's
    unfortunate, because it's an amazing tool. In this tutorial, we'll
    get you rolling with Doctrine: learn how to use it, how to get
    hard work done easily and how to avoid the common pitfalls that
    *can* make Doctrine hard:

    * Creating entity classes
    * Managing migrations
    * Saving new data
    * Querying for data
    * Custom repositories
    * Custom queries and the query builder
    * Fixtures (Dummy data) using Faker

    ... and (like always) a lot more goodies are mixed in.
